This application is a versatile tool combining a calculator and number sorter, built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by entering two numbers and selecting the desired operation. The result is displayed within the application interface. Additionally, the app features a sorting function that accepts a list of 5 to 10 numbers, entered as a space-separated string, and sorts them using the bubble sort algorithm. The sorted result is shown on the GUI.

An added feature of the application is file handling, which allows users to load numbers from a text file for sorting. The user can select a file containing numbers, which the app reads, validates, and displays in the entry widget for sorting. This makes the app flexible for various numeric tasks, whether the data is entered manually or loaded from a file. The application includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and operations like division by zero, ensuring robust performance. Overall, this app is a handy tool for performing basic calculations and sorting tasks within a user-friendly interface.
